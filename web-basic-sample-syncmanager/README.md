## SyncManager

`SyncManager` is a support add-on for [SendBird SDK](https://github.com/sendbird/SendBird-SDK-JavaScript). Major benefits of `SyncManager` are,  
  
 * Local cache integrated: store channel/message data in local storage for fast view loading.  
 * Event-driven data handling: subscribe channel/message event like `insert`, `update`, `remove` at a single spot in order to apply data event to view.  
  
Check out [Basic Sample with SyncManager](https://github.com/sendbird/SendBird-JavaScript/tree/master/web-basic-sample-syncmanager) which is similar to [Basic Sample](https://sample.sendbird.com/basic) but `SyncManager` integrated. For more information about `SyncManager`, please refer to [SyncManager README](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-syncmanager-javascript/blob/master/README.md).
